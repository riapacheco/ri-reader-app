<h3 id="boilerplate-statement">Boilerplate Statement</h3>
<p>RiReader is a neural net powered application, for avid readers of physical books, that want to record key ideas with the least effort possible, build out thinking frameworks with a better intuitive understanding of what they&#39;re reading in the first place, and want to ensure that what they look at is useful.</p>
<h3 id="value-propositions">Value Propositions</h3>
<h4 id="maximize-reading-flow-efficiency-with-effortless-note-taking">Maximize Reading Flow Efficiency with Effortless Note-Taking</h4>
<p>Keep your reading session uninterrupted and capture notes (&quot;passages&quot;) with ease with a neural net based OCR engine that captures text from your physical books right to the app even under relatively low-lit conditions.</p>
<h4 id="capture-key-ideas-intuitively">Capture Key Ideas Intuitively</h4>
<p>Store passages, along with contextual notes and tags, to easily review important ideas and refresh each idea&#39;s impact every time you open the app.</p>
<h4 id="think-bigger-with-weighted-scoring">Think Bigger with Weighted Scoring</h4>
<p>Find out what&#39;s most important to <em>you</em> with weighted book scoring you can adjust, covering the author&#39;s content organization, use of citations, use of emotion, and any other aspects that might impact the experience.</p>

<h3 id="user-stories">User Stories</h3>
<h4 id="v1">V1</h4>
<ol>
<li>As a user, I want to <strong>record physical book passages (1 - 5 sentences) from my smartphone&#39;s camera to the app</strong>, so that my reading flow isn&#39;t disrupted from physical note-taking</li>
<li>As a user, I want my recorded book passages to <strong>include their specific page numbers</strong> so that I can refer to passages years into the future</li>
<li>As a user, I want to <strong>edit the book passages</strong> that are saved from my smartphone&#39;s camera so that I can correct any errors from the OCR engine not identifying lines / blobs correctly</li>
<li>As a user, I want to <strong>add contextual notes to any saved book passages I store in the app</strong>, so that I can jog my memory on why it was significant and how I felt about it</li>
<li>As a user, I want to <strong>apply overall scores (performance grades) to a book</strong> so that I can more organically understand my own reading preferences and make it so I&#39;m more likely to retain important information</li>
<li>As a user, I want to <strong>enable book scoring at any time (during my reading a book AND when it&#39;s finished)</strong>, so that I don&#39;t lose my train of thought on a book and can read multiple books at once</li>
<li>As a user, I want to optionally <strong>record completion progress of a book in a light way</strong> that doesn&#39;t force itself into my reading workflow, so that I can prioritize which book to continue reading when I decide it&#39;s important</li>
<li>As a user, I want to score books based on <strong>10 unique (and app suggested) categories that best reflect my personality and individual preferences</strong> so that I can build an intuitive mental repository of ideas (and the concepts that enabled them)</li>
<li>As a user, I want to <strong>change the scoring categories provided by the app (and have additionally suggested categories alongside those completely from scratch)</strong> so that I can explore what metrics make the most sense for my personality or end-goal</li>
<li>As a user, I want to <strong>add varied weights to each scoring category</strong> so that I can fine tune which categories are more important to my personal style</li>
<li>As a user, I want the <strong>scoring process to feel natural and impermanent</strong> so that it&#39;s done often and consistently reminds me what&#39;s important to my consumption of material</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="v2">V2+</h4>
<ol>
<li>As a user, I want to <strong>change the weighting of scoring categories from book to book</strong> so that I&#39;m able to create a higher level thinking framework during the reading process and retain highly diverse information</li>
<li>As a user, I want to <strong>connect ideas from one book passage idea to another book</strong> so that I can begin graphing concepts and ideas from different time periods, disciplines, and industries</li>
</ol>
