enables a user to both consume and retain data they've read from a physical book. \n\nProduct Marketing\nBoilerplate Statement\nRiReader is a neural net powered real-world helper app, designed for fans of physical books \nthat want to (1) record key ideas with minimal effort, (2) intuitively understand the content they're reading \nin a way that helps them fine-tune their own thinking framework; and (3) enables a confident understanding of \nwhat makes a good read \"good\" through a weighted scoring system that reflects their evolving preferences over time.\nValue Propositions\nMaximize Reading Flow Efficiency with Effortless Note-Taking\nKeep your reading sessions uninterrupted by storing multi-line passages from your favorite books & research papers, captured by \nyour smartphone's camera and the power of a neural net OCR engine that's been continuously fine-tuned (under Google's sponsorship) \nfor over the past 27 years!\nCapture Key Ideas Intuitively\nStore contextual notes, tags, and details with every book passage you capture, to easily review important ideas \nand refresh each idea's impact on the bigger picture every time you open the app.\nThink Bigger with Weighted Scoring\nGet to know what's important to you with a weighted and flexible book scoring system, covering criteria that includes the author's organization of content, \ntheir use of examples, and much more. \n\nGenerated Documentation View\nThis repo generates documentation through a locally run compodoc view. To view:\n\nDownload the repo\nRun npm install to install all dependencies required\nRun npm run docs to both generate documentation from inline comments and serve the documentation site\n\n\nFeature List\n\nCamera to text reader\nScoring categories\nWeighted scoring\nGraphing tools / visuals for summary metrics\nTrack multiple books concurrently\n\n\nUser Stories\nV1\n\nAs a user, I want to record physical book passages (1 - 5 sentences) from my smartphone's camera to the app, so that my reading flow isn't disrupted from physical note-taking\nAs a user, I want my recorded book passages to include their specific page numbers so that I can refer to passages years into the future\nAs a user, I want to edit the book passages that are saved from my smartphone's camera so that I can correct any errors from the OCR engine not identifying lines / blobs correctly\nAs a user, I want to add contextual notes to any saved book passages I store in the app, so that I can jog my memory on why it was significant and how I felt about it\nAs a user, I want to apply overall scores (performance grades) to a book so that I can more organically understand my own reading preferences and make it so I'm more likely to retain important information\nAs a user, I want to enable book scoring at any time (during my reading a book AND when it's finished), so that I don't lose my train of thought on a book and can read multiple books at once\nAs a user, I want to optionally record completion progress of a book in a light way that doesn't force itself into my reading workflow, so that I can prioritize which book to continue reading when I decide it's important\nAs a user, I want to score books based on 10 unique (and app suggested) categories that best reflect my personality and individual preferences so that I can build an intuitive mental repository of ideas (and the concepts that enabled them)\nAs a user, I want to change the scoring categories provided by the app (and have additionally suggested categories alongside those completely from scratch) so that I can explore what metrics make the most sense for my personality or end-goal\nAs a user, I want to add varied weights to each scoring category so that I can fine tune which categories are more important to my personal style\nAs a user, I want the scoring process to feel natural and impermanent so that it's done often and consistently reminds me what's important to my consumption of material\n\nV2+\n\nAs a user, I want to change the weighting of scoring categories from book to book so that I'm able to create a higher level thinking framework during the reading process and retain highly diverse information\nAs a user, I want to connect ideas from one book passage idea to another book so that I can begin graphing concepts and ideas from different time periods, disciplines, and industries\n\n\nFirting with Models\nEntity Relationship Diagram [ERD]\nerDiagram\n    Book {\n        number id PK\n
