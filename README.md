# RiReader
Since I read too many books to track, I wanted to build myself an app that could help me take notes (via image-to-text conversion aka OCR) 
and would allow me to create and apply a weighted scoring system. Figured I'd build it for both web and iOS (and maybe android).

#### Feature List [maybe]
1. Camera to text reader
2. Scoring categories
3. Weighted scoring
4. Graphing tools / visuals for summary metrics
5. Track multiple books concurrently
