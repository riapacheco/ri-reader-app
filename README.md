# RiReader
As an avid reader, I want an app that helps me track important passages via image-to-text conversion, allows me to flexibly create a weighted scoring system, and is offered in both web an ios.

Features (likely):
1. Converted text from camera to note (via OCR)
2. Scoring categories with weights applied to them
3. Graph visuals for reviewing 
4. Summary of best books / why or whatever insights come out of the wash that make the most sense.
5. Stored images of covers
6. Read multiple books at once
