# RiReader
Since I read too many books to track, I wanted to build myself an app that could help me take notes (via image-to-text conversion aka OCR) 
and would allow me to create and apply a weighted scoring system. Figured I'd build it for both web and iOS (and maybe android).

### Feature List
1. Camera to text reader
2. Scoring categories
3. Weighted scoring
4. Graphing tools / visuals for summary metrics
5. Track multiple books concurrently

### User Stories
#### V1
1. As a user, I want to **record physical book passages (1 - 5 sentences) from my smartphone's camera to the app**, so that my reading flow isn't disrupted from physical note-taking
2. As a user, I want my recorded book passages to **include their specific page numbers** so that I can refer to passages years into the future
3. As a user, I want to **edit the book passages** that are saved from my smartphone's camera so that I can correct any errors from the OCR engine not identifying lines / blobs correctly
4. As a user, I want to **add contextual notes to any saved book passages I store in the app**, so that I can jog my memory on why it was significant and how I felt about it
5. As a user, I want to **apply overall scores (performance grades) to a book** so that I can more organically understand my own reading preferences and make it so I'm more likely to retain important information
6. As a user, I want to **enable book scoring at any time (during my reading a book AND when it's finished)**, so that I don't lose my train of thought on a book and can read multiple books at once
7. As a user, I want to optionally **record completion progress of a book in a light way** that doesn't force itself into my reading workflow, so that I can prioritize which book to continue reading when I decide it's important
8. As a user, I want to score books based on **10 unique (and app suggested) categories that best reflect my personality and individual preferences** so that I can build an intuitive mental repository of ideas (and the concepts that enabled them)
9. As a user, I want to **change the scoring categories provided by the app (and have additionally suggested categories alongside those completely from scratch)** so that I can explore what metrics make the most sense for my personality or end-goal
10. As a user, I want to **add varied weights to each scoring category** so that I can fine tune which categories are more important to my personal style
11. As a user, I want the **scoring process to feel natural and impermanent** so that it's done often and consistently reminds me what's important to my consumption of material


#### V2+
1. As a user, I want to **change the weighting of scoring categories from book to book** so that I'm able to create a higher level thinking framework during the reading process and retain highly diverse information
2. As a user, I want to **connect ideas from one book passage idea to another book** so that I can begin graphing concepts and ideas from different time periods, disciplines, and industries
